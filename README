To use this dockerfile :
First, build the dockerfile by running the following command : docker build -t "name-of-the-celix-image-builder" .
It will create a docker image that can build the docker image with celix in it

Then run the following command : docker run -ti --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock name-of-the-celix-image-builder
It will create your final small docker image with Apache Celix in it. The image is about 16MB.

Finally you will have a docker image named celix.image on your host, you can check by running the following command : docker images.

If you want more information about the Dockerfile, see the comments in the Dockerfile.

If you want more information about how I have made the buildroot environment, see the README file in this repository on github :
