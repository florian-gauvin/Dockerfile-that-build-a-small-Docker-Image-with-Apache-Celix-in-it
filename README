Here you can find a Dockerfile that can create a small docker image with Apache Celix.
To use this dockerfile :
First, build the dockerfile by running the following command : docker build -t "name-of-the-celix-image-builder" .
This will create a builder image of Apache Celix

Then Run the following command : docker run -ti --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock name-of-the-celix-image-builder
This will launch the builder image of Apache Celix and create automatically the small image with Apache Celix in it. The image is about 16MB

Finally you will have a docker image named celix.image on your host, you can check by running the following command : "docker images".

BE CAREFUL : 
	-You need to have the same docker version than there is in the image, in the image I'm using the latest version of docker by running the following command : wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh

If you want more information about the dockerfile, see the comments in the Dockerfile.
